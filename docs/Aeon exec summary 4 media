Executive Summary – AEON Media Operating System
AEON Investments Technologies LLC is building the AEON Media Operating System — a comprehensive, AI-driven, full-stack media automation platform designed to generate, optimize, and distribute professional-grade content at scale. This isn’t just another SaaS; it’s a modular, tile-based web environment where users navigate like an operating system, accessing powerful AI applications for image, video, audio, and text creation — all backed by intelligent agent orchestration and advanced post-processing.

Core Objective
To create the world’s most advanced AI-powered media OS that:

Generates high-performing multimedia assets in any niche.

Optimizes them for virality across every major social platform.

Automates workflows from scriptwriting to publishing.

Monetizes via subscription tiers, pay-per-credit, and affiliate integrations.

Scales horizontally to handle millions of jobs without degrading performance.

Platform Architecture
Frontend (React/Next.js 14 + TypeScript)
OS-style Dashboard: Tile/grid layout for intuitive navigation — each tile launches a dedicated AI studio (Image Hub, Video Studio, Audio Suite, Script Lab, Optimization Tools).

Role-Based Access Control for teams, agencies, and enterprise clients.

Responsive Design with dark mode, PWA support, and mobile optimization.

Real-Time Previews & Status Indicators for jobs in queue or processing.

Backend (FastAPI + Python Async Stack)
Microservice-Based Architecture for scalability and fault isolation.

Redis Job Queues for async task management.

PostgreSQL + S3 Storage for asset management, metadata, and analytics.

Webhook & API Key Management Layer for integrating external AI providers (Replicate.com, Hailuo, Runway, Pika, Ideogram, etc.).

Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring via Prometheus + Grafana.

Core AI Modules
Image Generation Hub
Text-to-Image with leading models (FLUX, Ideogram).

Background removal, upscaling, restoration.

Style transfer, artistic filters, and face-swaps.

Batch processing for bulk asset creation.

Video Generation Studio

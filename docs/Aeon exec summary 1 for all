Executive Summary – AEON: The AI Operating System for Business
AEON Investments Technologies LLC is building AEON, a production-ready, multi-tenant SaaS platform that unifies all enterprise-grade AI capabilities into a single, intelligent dashboard. AEON enables businesses to automate their entire workflow — from ideation, content creation, and marketing, to customer management, sales, operations, and analytics — without juggling multiple disconnected tools.

AEON is not another “point solution.” It is the Salesforce of AI — a fully integrated, modular, and extensible AI operating system that grows with the business and becomes mission-critical to daily operations.

Platform Vision
A tile-based OS-style dashboard (desktop-like interface) where each AI capability is its own “app” — Media Suite, CRM, ERP, Marketing, Automation, Dev Tools — all seamlessly connected. Users log in and see a curated workspace, not an overwhelming wall of features.

Each module is:

Fully isolated for focus.

Interconnected for cross-workflow automation.

Customizable for different industries and roles.

Core Architecture
Frontend: Next.js 14+ + TypeScript + shadcn/ui, dark mode, PWA capabilities.

Backend: Python FastAPI (async), Redis queues, PostgreSQL (sharded for multi-tenancy).

Auth: JWT + role-based permissions, tenant isolation, enterprise SSO.

Storage: AWS S3 + CDN for global delivery.

Infra: Docker, Kubernetes orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, blue-green deployment.

Security: SOC 2, GDPR/CCPA compliance, audit logging, API rate limits.
